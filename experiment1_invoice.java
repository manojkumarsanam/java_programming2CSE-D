/*

Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent an invoice for an item sold at the store.

An Invoice should include four pieces of information as instance variables-a part number (type String), a part description (type String),a quantity of the item being purchased (type int) and a price per item (double).

Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four instance variables.

Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable.

In addition, provide a method named getInvoiceAmount() that calculates the invoice amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per item), then returns the amount as a double value. If the quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. If the price per item is not positive, it should be set to 0.0.

Write a test application named InvoiceTest that demonstrates class Invoiceâ€™s capabilities.
