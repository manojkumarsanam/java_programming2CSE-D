Experiment 5 - Binary Search

To search for a word in a dictionary, you donâ€™t review all the words; you just check one word in the middle and thus narrow down the set of remaining words to check. The divide and conquer principle may be helpful to search for a given word in a dictionary.

Consider a sorted a list of numbers to apply the principle.
