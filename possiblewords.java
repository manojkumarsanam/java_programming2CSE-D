Identify Possible Words
Detective Sherlock Holmes while solving a case stumbled upon a letter which has many words whose one character was 
missing i.e., one character in the word was replaced by an underscore. For eg. “Fi_er”. He also found a thin strips of paper 
which had a group of words separated by semicolons, for eg, “Fever;filer;Filter;Fixer;fiber;tailor;offer”. He could figure out 
that the word whose one character was missing was one of the possible words from the thin strips of paper. Detective 
Holmes has approached you ( a trustworthy friend and a computer programmer) asking help in identifying the possible 
words for each incomplete word.
You are expected to write a method to identify the set of possible words. The method identifyPossibleWords takes two 
strings as input. Input1 contains the incomplete word and input2 is the string containing a set of words separated by 
semicolons.
